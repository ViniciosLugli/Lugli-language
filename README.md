# Lugli language compiler
My 'Lugli' language compiler for learning purposes, written in rust. This language is to be a subset for other purposes, for example, a simple language to use on math problems and logical learning, but also it is a good example of how to write a compiler.

# Compiler usage / commands
### Run
```bash
[Executable] run <file path>
```
Example: `Lugli.exe run foo.lg`
