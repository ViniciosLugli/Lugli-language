# Lugli language compiler
My 'lugli' language compiler for learning purposes, written in rust. This language is to be a subset for other purposes, for example, a simple language to use on math problems and logical learning, but also it is a good example of how to write a compiler.

# Compiler features
* [x] tokenizer / lexer
* [x] parser
* [x] runtime (compiler)
* [ ] Module system (simple creation of libs)
* [ ] Linker (for other languages)
* [ ] Optimizer / FMT
* [ ] Debugger tools
